**Windows named pipes and Unix domain sockets as a [`coqui-peer`](https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-peer)
transport and a [`coqui-transport`](https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-transport) transport, with the
operating system's access control on by default.** Every `coqui-peer` driver and every method runs over it
unchanged, and with the `channel` feature a `coqui_transport::StreamChannel` runs on a stream. It proves no key: a
method does that over the stream, and what the operating system says about the other end is reported beside it.
See the [documentation](https://boriken-dev.github.io/coqui-transport-pipe/).

> **Status: alpha.** `0.0.0-alpha.0` is unreleased: depend on a git revision. The API may change at any commit.
> Tested on Windows, Linux and FreeBSD; the macOS path is written and has not been run.

## Features

- **One API over both platforms**: `PipeName`, `Listener::bind` and `accept`, `Stream::connect`.
- **Who may connect, by default**: on Windows a descriptor for the current user alone, a name that exists is
  refused rather than joined, clients on other hosts are refused, and a client connects at the identification level,
  so a server cannot act as it. On Unix a `0600` socket from the moment its path exists, in a directory only its owner
  can write, with a socket left behind removed only when nothing listens on it.
- **Your choice, and visible**: every default can be loosened on a builder; what differs from its default is listed by `non_defaults()`
  and logged at `debug` through `tracing`. The crate reports and the caller decides: only the application knows whether a
  shared socket or a long timeout was meant.
- **Every `coqui-peer` driver**: `Read + Write`, `ReadTimeout` and `WriteTimeout` for streams, so deadlines hold;
  `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` under `tokio`.
- **`coqui-transport` channels**: a `Stream` is a `Split`, so `StreamChannel::start(stream, codec)` is a channel of whole
  messages on it, with the framing the caller chooses (this crate picks none); `Connector` and `Listener` implement the
  crate's connector and listener traits.
- **A socket shared with a group** (Unix): `socket_group` or `socket_group_name` with `socket_mode(0o660)`, applied
  before the socket can be connected to; a group the process cannot set is refused.
- **Nothing dropped silently**: a setting this platform cannot honour is refused when it would be stricter than the
  default, and listed by `not_applied()` when it is meaningless here.
- **The other end's OS identity** (`SO_PEERCRED`, the client's token), as information, never in place of a key proof.

## Installation

```bash
cargo add coqui-transport-pipe --git https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-transport-pipe
```

| Feature | Adds | Needed for | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tokio` | `tokio`, `coqui-peer/tokio`, `coqui-transport/tokio` | module `asynch`: async listener, stream, messages and connector | off |
| `channel` | nothing | `Stream` as a `coqui_transport::Split`, with `ReadHalf` and `WriteHalf` | off |

Rust 1.89 or later. A default build depends on `coqui-peer`, `coqui-transport` (no features), `tracing`, on Windows
`windows-sys`, and on Unix `socket2` and `libc`.

## Quick start

Bytes between two ends; `PipeName::named("my-service")` is the usual name:

```rust
use std::io::{Read, Write};
use coqui_transport_pipe::{Listener, PipeName, Stream};

# let directory = tempfile::tempdir()?;
# let name = format!("readme-bytes-{}", std::process::id());
# let name = PipeName::named_in(directory.path(), &name)?;
let listener = Listener::bind(&name)?;
let mut client = Stream::connect(&name)?;
let mut server = listener.accept()?;
client.write_all(b"hello")?;
let mut buffer = [0; 5];
server.read_exact(&mut buffer)?;
assert_eq!(&buffer, b"hello");
assert_eq!(server.peer()?.is_current_user()?, Some(true));
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

A key proof over it, with a deadline, here by Noise:

```rust
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
use coqui_peer::{Method, drive_stream_until};
use coqui_peer_noise::{Identity, Noise, Trust};
use coqui_transport_pipe::{Listener, PipeName, Stream};

# let directory = tempfile::tempdir()?;
# let name = format!("readme-noise-{}", std::process::id());
# let name = PipeName::named_in(directory.path(), &name)?;
let (ours, theirs) = (Identity::generate()?, Identity::generate()?);
let (our_id, their_id) = (ours.peer_id(), theirs.peer_id());
let dialling = Noise::builder(ours).responders(Trust::pinned([their_id])).build();
let answering = Noise::builder(theirs).initiators(Trust::pinned([our_id])).build();

let listener = Listener::bind(&name)?;
let mut client = Stream::connect(&name)?;
let mut server = listener.accept()?;
let until = Instant::now() + Duration::from_secs(10);
let served = std::thread::spawn(move || {
    drive_stream_until(answering.respond(None).unwrap(), &mut server, until).map(|done| done.peer)
});
let established = drive_stream_until(dialling.initiate()?, &mut client, until)?;
assert_eq!(established.peer, their_id);
assert_eq!(served.join().unwrap()?, our_id);
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

A setting that differs from its default is a choice, and is reported:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use coqui_transport_pipe::{Listener, PipeName};

let directory = tempfile::tempdir()?;
let name = PipeName::named_in(directory.path(), "readme-builder")?;
let builder = Listener::builder(&name).read_timeout(Duration::MAX);
assert_eq!(builder.non_defaults()[0].setting, "read_timeout");
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

## API overview

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `coqui_transport_pipe` | `PipeName`, `Listener`, `ListenerBuilder`, `ListenerSettings`, `Stream`, `ConnectBuilder`, `ConnectSettings`, `Connector`, `OsIdentity`, `Error`, `ReadHalf` and `WriteHalf` (`channel`), and `coqui-peer`'s `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout` and `NonDefault`. |
| `coqui_transport_pipe::asynch` | The listener, the stream and `Connector` over tokio (`tokio`). |

## Limits

- A browser cannot reach a pipe or a socket: this is for native clients.
- Name squatting: a listener that bound first cannot be displaced, but a client that connects to a name nobody
  legitimate holds yet reaches whoever does. The key proof is what protects it.
- On Windows a write past its timeout refuses every later write on that stream, since a cancelled pipe write does not
  say how much the peer took. On Unix a write reports what it wrote.
- `<path>.lock` stays beside a Unix socket when its listener ends.

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features
cargo +nightly-2026-09-21 public-api --all-features -sss --color never | diff -u tools/public-api.txt -
```

Run these on Windows and on a Unix: the two share an API and little code. Tests that run a client as another user
need root; `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the repository says how.

### Releasing

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and keeps a
[`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-transport-pipe/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
Pushing a tag matching `v*` runs the release workflow: the tests and a strict documentation build gate a GitHub
release, marked as a pre-release when the version has a `-` suffix. Nothing is published to crates.io while the crate
depends on its family by git revision.
