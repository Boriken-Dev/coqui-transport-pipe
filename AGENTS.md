# `coqui-transport-pipe` — API header

Header-file-style reference for the `coqui-transport-pipe` crate: every public item with its signature,
contract and gotchas, so the crate can be used without reading its source. It ships inside the
package and is self-contained. Development documentation lives with the source at
<https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-transport-pipe>.

| Feature | Adds | Needed for | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tokio` | `tokio` (`net`, `io-util`, `time`), `coqui-peer/tokio`, `coqui-transport/tokio` | module `asynch` | off |
| `channel` | nothing | `Stream: coqui_transport::Split`, with `ReadHalf` and `WriteHalf`, so `StreamChannel::start` runs on a stream | off |

MSRV Rust 1.89. A default build depends on `coqui-peer` (by git revision, `b6aa1f4`), `coqui-transport` (by git
revision, `cb11ff2`, no features), `tracing`, on Windows `windows-sys`, and on Unix `socket2` and `libc`. Version
`0.0.0-alpha.0`, unreleased: depend on a git revision, and name the same `coqui-peer` and `coqui-transport`
revisions if you use them directly. This is a transport of `coqui-peer` and of `coqui-transport`, not a method: it
proves no key, and a method runs over it.

Imports: the crate root holds `PipeName`, `Listener`, `ListenerOptions`, `Stream`, `ConnectOptions`,
`OsIdentity`, `current_user`, `Connector`, `Error`, `ReadHalf` and `WriteHalf` (feature `channel`), the
`DEFAULT_` constants, and re-exports of `coqui-peer`'s `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout` and `NonDefault` (the report
every `non_defaults()` and `not_applied()` returns: `setting`, `value`, `default`). One public module: `asynch` (feature `tokio`).

`unsafe` only for the operating system's calls, in `src/sys/windows.rs` and `src/sys/unix_os.rs`; a test
lists them. No process-wide state. A library prints nothing: a setting looser than its default is
returned by `non_defaults()` (what, its default and its value) and logged at `debug` through `tracing`, never
warned: the crate reports and the caller decides. Nothing reads a file or an environment
variable unless the caller asks: `PipeName::named` and parsing `pipe:NAME` read two on Unix.

Tested on Windows, Linux and FreeBSD (14.5: `getpeereid`, which gives no process there). The macOS path (`getpeereid`, `LOCAL_PEERPID`) is written and has not been
run.

## Names (`coqui_transport_pipe::PipeName`)

```rust
pub struct PipeName;   // Clone, Debug, Eq, Hash, Display, FromStr, AsRef<Path>, Send, Sync
impl PipeName {
    pub fn named(name: &str) -> Result<PipeName, Error>;       // Windows \\.\pipe\NAME; Unix $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/NAME.sock, else $TMPDIR/NAME.sock
    pub fn named_in(directory: impl AsRef<Path>, name: &str) -> Result<PipeName, Error>;   // Unix DIRECTORY/NAME.sock; Windows ignores directory
    pub fn at(path: impl AsRef<Path>) -> Result<PipeName, Error>;      // a socket path; on Windows \\.\pipe\NAME or \\HOST\pipe\NAME
    pub fn on_host(host: &str, name: &str) -> Result<PipeName, Error>; // Windows \\HOST\pipe\NAME; Error::Unsupported on Unix
    pub fn path(&self) -> &Path;
}
```

`name` is one or more of `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ -` and does not start with a dot. `at` on Windows takes a `NAME`
that may group with `\`, without `/`, a control character, a `.` or `..` part, or a part ending in a dot or a
space (which Win32 would drop, giving one pipe two names), and a `HOST` that is `.` or holds only
`A-Z a-z 0-9 . - : _ [ ] %`; anything else is `Error::InvalidName`. `at` on Unix refuses an empty path, one with no file name, or one too long for `sun_path`, counting
the 11 bytes a bind's private directory adds. On Windows a name is held in ASCII lower case, since the system
compares them without case: two cases are one equal value.

Text: `pipe:NAME` (on Windows any `NAME` `at` takes, `GROUP\NAME` included), `unix:PATH`, or a whole path (`\\.\`
on Windows, `/` on Unix). **Text never names another host**: `\\HOST\pipe\NAME` is `Error::InvalidName` from
`FromStr`, since opening it sends this user's credentials to that host; `at` and `on_host` name one on purpose.
`Display` is canonical and parses back, but for a Unix path that is not UTF-8 and another host's pipe. `unix:`
on Windows is `Error::Unsupported`.

Environment: the first of `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and `TMPDIR` that holds an absolute path; neither is
`Error::NoRuntimeDirectory`. The bind then judges that directory like any other, so `TMPDIR=/tmp` is
refused.

## Listening (`coqui_transport_pipe::{Listener, ListenerOptions}`)

```rust
pub struct Listener;   // Debug, Send, Sync
impl Listener {
    pub fn bind(name: &PipeName) -> Result<Listener, Error>;
    pub fn options() -> ListenerOptions;
    pub fn accept(&self) -> Result<Stream, Error>;                                        // waits forever
    pub fn accept_timeout(&self, timeout: Option<Duration>) -> Result<Stream, Error>;     // Error::TimedOut; the listener goes on
    pub fn name(&self) -> &PipeName;
    pub fn non_defaults(&self) -> &[NonDefault];
    pub fn not_applied(&self) -> &[NonDefault];
}
pub struct ListenerOptions;   // Clone, Debug, Default = new(), must_use; every method takes and returns self but the last two
impl ListenerOptions {
    pub fn new() -> ListenerOptions;
    pub fn allow_remote_clients(self, bool);            // Windows; default false: PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS. NonDefault
    pub fn security_descriptor(self, sddl: impl Into<String>);   // Windows; default: this user alone. NonDefault
    pub fn first_instance(self, bool);                  // Windows; default true: FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE. NonDefault
    pub fn max_instances(self, u32);                    // Windows; 2..=254, 255 (default) is the system's own limit
    pub fn buffer_size(self, u32);                      // Windows; each direction, default DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE
    pub fn socket_mode(self, u32);                      // Unix; default 0o600, any of 0..=0o7777. Another is reported by non_defaults(), never refused
    pub fn socket_group(self, gid: u32);                // Unix; default the process's own. Another is a non-default setting
    pub fn socket_group_name(self, name: impl Into<String>);   // Unix; resolved at bind
    pub fn allow_shared_directory(self, bool);          // Unix; default false. NonDefault
    pub fn remove_stale(self, bool);                    // Unix; default true
    pub fn backlog(self, i32);                          // Unix; above 0, default DEFAULT_BACKLOG
    pub fn read_timeout(self, Option<Duration>);        // accepted streams; default Some(DEFAULT_IO_TIMEOUT); longer is a non-default setting
    pub fn write_timeout(self, Option<Duration>);       // the same
    pub fn non_defaults(&self) -> Vec<NonDefault>;           // looser than the default, on this platform
    pub fn not_applied(&self) -> Vec<NonDefault>;        // changed from the default and meaningless on this platform
    pub fn bind(self, name: &PipeName) -> Result<Listener, Error>;   // Error::InvalidOptions for what means nothing
}
pub const DEFAULT_IO_TIMEOUT: Duration;      // 30 s
pub const DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Duration; // 5 s
pub const DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE: u32;          // 64 KiB
pub const DEFAULT_BACKLOG: i32;              // 128
pub const DEFAULT_SOCKET_MODE: u32;          // 0o600
```

**Reporting, not judging.** Whether a looser setting was meant is the caller's to say: the crate never warns. Every
setting looser than its default is returned by `non_defaults()` (on the options, the listener, `ConnectOptions`) and logged at
`debug`. A setting changed from its default that this platform cannot honour is never dropped silently: one that would
be stricter than the default is `Error::InvalidOptions` at `bind` (Windows: `socket_group`, `remove_stale(false)`; Unix:
`security_descriptor`, `max_instances` below 255), one that is meaningless here is returned by `not_applied()` (Windows:
`socket_mode`, `allow_shared_directory`, `backlog`; Unix: `buffer_size`, `allow_remote_clients`, `first_instance(false)`,
and `allow_impersonation(true)` on `ConnectOptions`) and logged at `debug`.

**On Windows**, `bind` creates the first instance and the one after it with the descriptor
`O:<SID>D:P(A;;GA;;;<SID>)`, for the user this thread runs as, plus, when its token is above medium integrity
(elevated), the label `S:(ML;;NWNRNX;;;<its level>)`, so a process of the same user below that level (not
elevated, or sandboxed) can neither connect nor add instances. `security_descriptor` replaces all of it: no label
is added, a text with no DACL gets the token's default DACL, a NUL in it is `Error::InvalidDescriptor`, and so is
one that does not let this user add instances (seen at `bind`). A name that exists is `Error::NameTaken` (the
system's `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`), whoever made it; with `first_instance(false)` the pipe joined keeps its own
descriptor. One instance always waits for the next client, and the next is made before a client is taken, so the
name is never free while the listener lives. Callers of `accept` on one listener wait in turn, and
`accept_timeout`'s bound covers that wait. Clients through file sharing (`\\HOST\pipe\NAME`) are refused unless
`allow_remote_clients`, and reach the system's own check as well: the descriptor applies to them too.

**On Unix**, `bind`, in this order:

1. judges the parent directory, both as written (not following links, since clients open that name) and resolved:
   refuses (`Error::SharedDirectory`) when others can write the socket's directory, sticky or not, or a directory
   above it that is not sticky; refuses (`Error::ForeignDirectory`) when a user other than this one or root owns
   any of them, or a link on the way as written. `allow_shared_directory` skips this;
2. takes an advisory lock on `<path>.lock` (mode `0600`, no symbolic link followed), held as long as the listener:
   already held is `Error::NameTaken`. The file stays when the listener ends;
3. looks at the path, not following a link. Not a socket is `Error::NotASocket`, and it is left alone. A socket
   of another user is `Error::NameTaken`. A socket something answers on is `Error::NameTaken`. Otherwise it is
   stale and removed, unless `remove_stale(false)`, then `Error::NameTaken`;
4. binds in a private directory beside it, sets the group (`socket_group`) and the mode, then links it to the path, so the
   socket is never seen with another group or mode, and removes the directory.

`socket_group` (or `socket_group_name`, looked up at bind) is for a socket shared with a group, as `/run/canoa/<user>.sock`
owned by the user and the group `canoa` with `socket_mode(0o660)`: a member connects, anyone else is refused by the mode. The
process must be root or a member of the group: otherwise `Error::GroupDenied`, refused before the lock or the path is
touched; a name no group has is `Error::UnknownGroup`. A group other than the process's own is in `non_defaults()`. On
Windows it is `Error::InvalidOptions`.

Dropping the listener removes the path if it is still this socket.

## Streams (`coqui_transport_pipe::{Stream, ConnectOptions}`)

```rust
pub struct Stream;     // Debug, Send, Sync
impl Stream {
    pub fn connect(name: &PipeName) -> Result<Stream, Error>;
    pub fn options() -> ConnectOptions;
    pub fn peer(&self) -> io::Result<OsIdentity>;
    pub fn shutdown(&self) -> io::Result<()>;
}
impl Read + Write + ReadTimeout + WriteTimeout for Stream;
impl Read + Write + ReadTimeout + WriteTimeout for &Stream;
pub struct ConnectOptions;   // Clone, Debug, Default = new(), must_use
impl ConnectOptions {
    pub fn new() -> ConnectOptions;
    pub fn timeout(self, Duration);                 // default DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: for a free instance or a place in the queue
    pub fn allow_impersonation(self, bool);         // Windows; default false: SECURITY_IDENTIFICATION. NonDefault
    pub fn read_timeout(self, Option<Duration>);    // default Some(DEFAULT_IO_TIMEOUT); longer is a non-default setting
    pub fn write_timeout(self, Option<Duration>);   // the same
    pub fn non_defaults(&self) -> Vec<NonDefault>;
    pub fn not_applied(&self) -> Vec<NonDefault>;    // Unix: allow_impersonation(true), which does nothing there
    pub fn connect(self, name: &PipeName) -> Result<Stream, Error>;
}
```

`connect` errors: `NotListening` (at once), `AccessDenied` (this user or, through file sharing, this client),
`TimedOut`, `Io`. Nothing proves who listens: run a key proof over the stream.

Every duration in this crate, options and calls alike, that is too long for the clock (`Duration::MAX`) waits as
`None` would. On Unix a write to a peer that left is `BrokenPipe` and never raises SIGPIPE, whatever the
process's disposition (`MSG_NOSIGNAL`, `SO_NOSIGPIPE` on Apple's systems).

A read past its timeout is `TimedOut`, on both platforms, and loses nothing. `Ok(0)` is the peer's end, and what
the peer wrote before closing is read first. `flush` does nothing: a write is on its way when it returns. A
timeout of zero is `InvalidInput`, as on a socket; `None` waits forever. **A write past its timeout on Windows
refuses every later write with `BrokenPipe`**: a cancelled pipe write reports 0 bytes even when the peer has
taken part of it (measured: 102,400 of 1 MiB read, 0 reported), so the stream's position is unknown. On Unix a
write reports what it wrote and `TimedOut` means nothing was.

`shutdown` ends both directions: a read or a write blocked in another thread returns, the read with `Ok(0)` and the
write with `BrokenPipe`, as do later ones; the peer reads what was written, then the end. Dropping does the
same.

**Drivers.** `drive_stream`, `complete_stream` and their `_until` forms take `&mut Stream` or `&mut &Stream`. The
`_until` forms clear both timeouts (`None`) before returning, as `coqui-peer` documents: set them again if the
stream goes on. `Method::respond` takes `None` as its source, so every peer on pipes shares one
bucket of a `TrustStore`'s waiting queue.

## Who is at the other end (`coqui_transport_pipe::{OsIdentity, current_user}`)

```rust
#[non_exhaustive] pub struct OsIdentity {
    pub process: Option<u32>,      // None for a client on another host
    pub user: Option<String>,      // a SID on Windows, a decimal uid on Unix
    pub group: Option<String>,     // Unix: a decimal gid
    pub session: Option<u32>,      // Windows
    pub host: Option<String>,      // Windows: a client's host, when it is another one
}
impl OsIdentity { pub fn is_current_user(&self) -> io::Result<Option<bool>>; }   // None when the system did not say
pub fn current_user() -> io::Result<String>;
```

Information for a log or a host's policy; it never replaces a key proof. On Unix: `SO_PEERCRED` on Linux,
`getpeereid` and `LOCAL_PEERPID` on macOS, the credentials at connect time. A Windows server: the client's process
and session from the pipe, its user from its token, read on a thread of its own by impersonating it at the level
the client allowed. That needs at least identification: a client of another program that sent no quality of
service and no data yet gives `user: None`, and so does one at anonymous level. A Windows client: the server's
process and session, and the owner of the pipe object, which only its creator (or a privileged process) chooses.
Neither says the integrity level: a sandboxed or non-elevated process of this user is reported as this user.

## Async (`coqui_transport_pipe::asynch`, feature `tokio`)

```rust
pub struct Listener;
impl Listener {
    pub fn bind(name: &PipeName) -> Result<Listener, Error>;
    pub fn bind_with(name: &PipeName, options: ListenerOptions) -> Result<Listener, Error>;
    pub async fn accept(&mut self) -> Result<Stream, Error>;   // cancelling loses nothing
    pub fn name(&self) -> &PipeName;
    pub fn non_defaults(&self) -> &[NonDefault];
}
pub struct Stream;     // AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin + Send
impl Stream {
    pub async fn connect(name: &PipeName) -> Result<Stream, Error>;
    pub async fn connect_with(name: &PipeName, options: ConnectOptions) -> Result<Stream, Error>;
    pub fn peer(&self) -> io::Result<OsIdentity>;
}
```

The same checks and instances as the blocking forms. Needs a tokio runtime with I/O enabled, and with time for
`_until` drivers and the waits for a free instance; tokio panics otherwise. These streams have no timeouts of their
own, and the options' read and write timeouts mean nothing here: wrap a call in `tokio::time::timeout`, or use
`coqui_peer::asynch`'s `_until` drivers. `poll_shutdown` ends the writing direction on Unix and does nothing on
Windows, where dropping the stream is the end.

## Channels and connectors (`coqui_transport_pipe::{ReadHalf, WriteHalf, Connector}`)

```rust
// feature `channel`
impl coqui_transport::Split for Stream { type Reader = ReadHalf; type Writer = WriteHalf; }
pub struct ReadHalf;    // Debug, Send; Read
pub struct WriteHalf;   // Debug, Send; Write; dropping it ends the writing direction

pub struct Connector;   // Clone, Debug, must_use
impl Connector {
    pub fn new(name: PipeName) -> Connector;
    pub fn with_options(self, ConnectOptions) -> Connector;
    pub fn name(&self) -> &PipeName;
}
impl coqui_transport::Connector for Connector { type Connection = Stream; type Error = Error; }   // connect(timeout) replaces the options' own
impl coqui_transport::Listener for Listener { type Connection = Stream; type Error = Error; }     // accept(): the inherent accept
```

`StreamChannel::start(stream, codec)` (or its `builder`) is the channel on a pipe. This crate picks no framing: the caller
hands `StreamChannel` a `coqui_transport::frame::Codec`. The channel's contract, bounds,
queueing and close are `coqui-transport`'s `StreamChannel`, which `AGENTS.md` there holds. It is not authenticated: run a key
proof on it before anything else.

`split` gives both halves one shared stream and an `Interrupt` that is `Stream::shutdown`, so a read blocked in the reader
thread is woken on close. The stream's own read and write timeouts stay (30 s by default; `StreamChannel` retries a timed-out
read or write). Dropping the `WriteHalf` is `shutdown(Write)` on Unix, so the peer reads the end while this side goes on
reading; on Windows a pipe has no half-close and it ends both directions. `Stream::peer` is asked before the stream is given
to `start`: the channel does not expose it.

`Connector::connect` and `Listener::accept` return the same `Stream` and errors as `Stream::connect` and the inherent
`accept`. With `tokio`, `asynch::Connector` is a `coqui_transport::asynch::AsyncConnector` (same fields and builder) and an
`asynch::Stream` is `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`, so `coqui_transport::asynch::StreamChannel::new(stream, codec)` runs on it.
`asynch::Listener` is not an `AsyncListener`: its `accept` takes `&mut self`.

## Errors

`Error` (non-exhaustive): `InvalidName`, `Unsupported`, `NoRuntimeDirectory`, `InvalidOptions`, `NameTaken`,
`NotASocket`, `SharedDirectory`, `ForeignDirectory`, `InvalidDescriptor`, `UnknownGroup`, `GroupDenied`, `NotListening`, `AccessDenied`, `TimedOut`,
`Io(io::Error)`. `Display` is one lowercase clause and quotes nothing. `From<io::Error>`, and `From<Error> for io::Error`
with a matching kind.

## Environment variables

Only for `PipeName::named` and `pipe:NAME` on Unix, read when called: `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, then `TMPDIR`, each counted
only when absolute.

## Gotchas

- A pipe name on Windows is visible to every user, and a socket path to whoever can search its directory. A
  squatter makes `bind` fail and cannot take a client from a listener that bound first, but a client that connects
  before any listener bound reaches the squatter: only the key proof protects it. `Stream::peer` says who owns the
  pipe.
- Windows: `\\HOST\pipe\NAME` needs the Server service on that host. Refused and denied both come back as
  `Error::AccessDenied`. Opening one is not bounded by `ConnectOptions::timeout`: the system waits for the network
  (measured: 21 s for an address that does not answer), and the async `connect` waits on its runtime thread.
- Windows: two clients can wait connected before an `accept`, on the waiting instance and the next; another then
  waits in `connect` until an `accept` makes room. There is no backlog setting.
- Unix: the bind's liveness probe takes a refused connect for a stale socket. A system that refuses a connect to a
  full queue (FreeBSD; not measured on macOS) can therefore make another program's live, saturated socket look
  stale; this crate's own listeners are protected by `<path>.lock`.
- `<path>.lock` stays beside a Unix socket by design: removing it would let two binders hold locks on two files.
- Windows, async: `poll_shutdown` ends nothing, so an async `StreamChannel`'s `close` does not end the stream for the peer
  until the stream is dropped.
- The `coqui-agentic-peer` link over a pipe is not tested here: `coqui-agentic-peer` still names `coqui-web-channel`'s
  `Channel`, which is not `coqui_transport::Channel` until it moves to that crate. That test (a sealed `Mux` link on
  a channel over a stream; the Noise and TLS handshake tests stay) returns with the dev-dependency when agentic-peer moves.
- A key-proof handshake and these streams have separate bounds: the stream's 30 s read timeout ends a silent
  `drive_stream`, and `_until` then replaces it.
- A long-lived stream read with no message pending gets `TimedOut` every 30 s by default: read again, or set `None`.
